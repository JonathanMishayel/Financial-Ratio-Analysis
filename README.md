## 📌 Project Overview
[cite_start]This project provides a comprehensive financial evaluation of **Jetwing Lighthouse Hotels PLC**, a prominent leader in Sri Lanka’s tourism and hospitality industry[cite: 23, 28].

## 🔍 Analysis Framework
[cite_start]The project utilizes **Ratio Analysis** to evaluate three core pillars of financial health[cite: 49, 50]:

### 1. Profitability Ratios

### 2. Liquidity Ratios
* [cite_start]**Current & Quick Ratios**: Assessing the company's ability to meet immediate liabilities without relying solely on inventory sales[cite: 72, 75].

### 3. Efficiency Ratios
* [cite_start]**Inventory Turnover**: Tracking the 38.59-day cycle of stock replacement[cite: 81, 85].
